# Cosingle
A small, dirty, hacky but user-friendly test math engine in Node.JS made
for fans of algebra, and of complex computations, and both together!

The API is `parser.js` and the command-line application is `main.js`.

It has a buggy and quirked nature. So report all the bugs you find!

## Operators
- Multiplication: "*", "."
- Sum: "+"
- Subtraction: "-"
- Function: "@"
- Equal: "=" (algebra)
- Division: "/", ":"
- Power: "^", "Â´"
- Root: "$"
